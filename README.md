# Effects

A Spigot particles plugin forked to work with [PGM](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM)


### Wiki

For information about how to use the plugin or API within the plugin, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Esophose/PlayerParticles/wiki)

### Server Compatibility 
This plugin is compatible with [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) and any forks, I recommend using [Paper](https://papermc.io/). 
Using CraftBukkit will not work. 
The versions of Minecraft that are currently supported are `1.16.1-1.7.10`.

### Compilation

PlayerParticles uses Gradle to compile and build the plugin. Run `./gradlew build` in the project's root directory to build the jar.
The plugin jar will be located in `./build/libs` when finished.
